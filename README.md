# rayTrace

Indoor radio based ray-tracing with human blockage. 

A demo visualization.

Current version is only with GIF support. However, you can retrieve multipath component via `ray_matrix` and `ray_connections`. **I will reformat the code and update the functions/documents in my spare time.**

And we know that channel model for wireless sensing can be divided into two parts: target unrelated (blue and yellow rays in above GIF), and target related (red rays in above GIF) . Here, target-unrelated components are modelled via image-based method (but it could be modeled as any existing wireless communication channel)ï¼Œ while target-related components can be obtained from primitive-based method.

The target-related channel is still not well studied, but I have developed one novel computer-vision based approach. You can refer to my [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10525191/) and another repository [testSpectrogram](https://github.com/rzy0901/testSpectrogram) for reference.

Acknowledgement: The first version of this repository was implemented on Mr. Ash Bellett's code three years ago at 2020 (When I was an undergraduate student at SUSTech). Big thanks for him! However, I could not find this codes' reference now, and if any one could find it, I will add it into this repository's citation.
